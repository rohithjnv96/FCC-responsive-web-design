                <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam life:</h2>
                <div class="content-section">
                    <ul>
                        <li class="bullet-points">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
                            Tamil Muslim family in the
                            pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in
                            the State
                            of Tamil Nadu.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points">Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras
                            Institute of Technology.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points">He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as
                            he placed ninth in
                            qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
                            Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                            Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points">In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research
                            Organisation (ISRO) where he was the
                            project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully
                            deployed the
                            Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points">In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and
                            Project Valiant, which sought to
                            develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the
                            disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for
                            these
                            aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points">The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in
                            which he played an intensive
                            political and technological role. </li>
                        <li class="bullet-points">Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R.
                            Narayanan. </li>
